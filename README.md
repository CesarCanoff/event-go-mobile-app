    This app was created with the main aim of providing a learning opportunity in mobile app development using React Native and TypeScript technology.
    I developed this project as a starting point to explore the fundamental concepts and best practices of development on one of the most popular platforms for creating mobile applications.

  ```

  1. Clone the repository:
  Open your terminal (Command Prompt for Windows) and execute the following command to clone the Event-Go repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/CesarCanoff/event-go-app.git
  ```

  2. Navigate to the app directory:
  Change to the Event-Go app directory that you just cloned:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/CesarCanoff/event-go-app.git
  ```

  3. Install dependencies:
  Use npm to install all the app's dependencies. This may take some time depending on the project's size:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
  4. Start the app with Expo:
  After the dependencies are successfully installed, you can start the Event-Go app using Expo Go. Run the following command:
  ```bash
  npx expo start
  ```

  5. Run on Emulator (Linux):
  If you're using Linux and want to run the app on an Android emulator, make sure you have an
  Android emulator like Android Studio's AVD Manager set up. Then, in the Expo DevTools that open in your browser, press "a" to run the app on the Android emulator.

  6. Run on Emulator (Windows):
  If you're using Windows and want to run the app on an Android emulator, ensure you have an Android emulator like Android Studio's AVD Manager
